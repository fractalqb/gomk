# gomk - Make things Go
[![Go
Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/git.fractalqb.de/fractalqb/gomk.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/git.fractalqb.de/fractalqb/gomk)

- Just a Go library module, no extra DSL to learn, and your Go IDE will help you
  right away.

- As portable as Go is â€“ as long as _you_ don't add any platform specifics.

- No extra tools implied. Having Go SDK installed, run a build script with `go
  run`.

You will find the details in the [Go
docs](https://pkg.go.dev/git.fractalqb.de/fractalqb/gomk). For a more pragmatic
approach, you should take a look at the [example](./example/mk.go) project.
